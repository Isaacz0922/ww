        <p>I have recently taken a trip to Maui, Hawaii! One of the highlights from the trip was hiking up to the top of Haleakalā to watch the sunrise with my family—it was an unforgettable experience.
            I ate a lot of local food, especially the fresh poke bowls and shave ice that everyone talks about. During my stay, my family and I explored the Road to Hana and took a snorkeling trip at Molokini Crater.
            I was also eager to learn more about Hawaiian culture, and we did a traditional luau while there. My mom and I even got tattoos representing our trip to Maui.</p>
